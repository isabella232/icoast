iCoast is a PHP/HTML/JS/CSS/MySQL based web application designed to 
harness the power of "crowdsourcing" to compare coastal imagery from 
both before and after extreme weather events. Questions are asked about 
visible changes and answers are recorded using admin configurable tags. 
The data is then used to help ground truth and improve existing 
predictive change models.

iCoast is live and can be found at:
