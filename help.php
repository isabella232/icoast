                                    externally issued credentials in this manner also increases user security
                                    by reducing the number of places in which sensitive information such as
                                    IDs and Passwords is stored.</p>

                                <p>iCoast is designed to dynamically adapt to the size of your screen but it
                                    requires a minimum resolution of 1280 pixels wide and 786 pixels high.
                                    Screens or windows smaller than this resolution may require the user to
                                    excessively scroll and may find it difficult to use iCoast.</p>

                                <p>There may be no single event that defines a storm in iCoast. Sometimes multiple events are represented by a
                                single image. &quot;Pre-storm/before&quot; designates the image taken earlier in time then the &quot;post-storm/after&quot;
                                image. Thus, &quot;pre-storm&quot; and &quot;before&quot; are interchangeable, as are &quot;post-storm&quot; and &quot;after&quot;.</p>

                                <p>When we survey the coast we try to fly the same flight path as previous surveys. However, it is very difficult to
                                fly the exact same track each time we fly. Moreover, we cannot know where each photo was taken on a
                                previous flight. Photos are taken every 2-4 seconds. The BEST match maybe one that shows the beach from a
                                slightly different angle, a wider or narrower field of view, or only match half the photo frame. Make the best
                                match you can, then tag the features you see in both photos.</p>

                                <p>No, it is difficult to provide an accurate scale bar for every
                                    photograph because of the variability in altitude, distance offshore,
                                    and field of view of each flight.</p>
